    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been handling many of my company’s email campaigns for some time now and I can honestly say that it’s been pretty fun from a technical stand-point. There’s a lot that goes into email marketing (not including the marketing/sales implications). It has it’s own conventions, ideologies, and I believe to the utmost that there’s a larger future than presumed in store for the sometimes misunderstood technology. (I’m patiently waiting for a mobile device header-type.)</p>

<p>Recently I’ve been using my new skills while working on my own applications using <a href="http://sendgrid.com/" title="SendGrid">SendGrid</a> as an alternative SMTP and email analytics tool. And I’ve only really come across one major programmable error. If you use a desktop client instead of a browser for viewing emails, as I do oftentimes, then this issue might not be so apparent (till now).</p>

<p>I recently was witness to how Gmail handles email headers in regards to HTML v. text-only. Gmail’s SaaS actually only reads the latter MIME-type and throws away the rest. So if you have a text version being made available, and you want your emails to be seen strictly as HTML, you must render the HTML version in your code LAST. Here is a Ruby on Rails example:</p>

<p>``` ruby
class Notifier &lt; ActionMailer::Base
  include SendGrid
  default :from => Rails.configuration.sendgrid.reply_to
  sendgrid_enable :opentrack, :clicktrack, :ganalytics
  sendgrid_category :testing</p>

<p>  def user_updated(user)</p>

<pre><code>@user = user
mail( :to =&gt; @user.email, 
      :subject =&gt; "Your information has been updated.") do |format|
  format.text { "#{user.first_name},\n\nThis is an auto-response to inform you that your information has changed." }
  format.html { render :layout =&gt; 'autoresponse' }
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Super “thanks” go out to the <a href="http://sendgrid.com/" title="SendGrid">SendGrid</a> crew for their constantly superior customer service skills and for helping me out on my way to becoming an email marketing specialist.</p>
