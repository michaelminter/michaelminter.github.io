    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently been working with AutoCAD files for <a href="http://sitefm.com">my company</a>. Because CAD files, or DWF/DWG files are based on a proprietory software package, there's not a lot of documentation on working with them, and even less if you want to render them in your own product.</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to come across <a href="http://cadviewer.com">CADViewer</a>. They're support is awesome and their product's API is superior to others available. The only catch is that they're a bit pricey. But eh.</p>

<pre><code>Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Java Console
</code></pre>

<p>... and select 'Show console' with any other options you'd like to show up.</p>
