    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been handling many of my company’s email campaigns for some time now and I can honestly say that it’s been pretty fun from a technical stand-point. There’s a lot that goes into email marketing (not including the marketing/sales implications). It has it’s own conventions, ideologies, and I believe to the utmost that there’s a larger future than presumed in store for the sometimes misunderstood technology. (I’m patiently waiting for a mobile device header-type.)</p>

<p>Recently I’ve been using my new skills while working on my own applications using <a href="http://sendgrid.com/" title="SendGrid">SendGrid</a> as an alternative SMTP and email analytics tool. And I’ve only really come across one major programmable error. If you use a desktop client instead of a browser for viewing emails, as I do oftentimes, then this issue might not be so apparent (till now).</p>

<p>I recently was witness to how Gmail handles email headers in regards to HTML v. text-only. Gmail’s SaaS actually only reads the latter MIME-type and throws away the rest. So if you have a text version being made available, and you want your emails to be seen strictly as HTML, you must render the HTML version in your code LAST. Here is a Ruby on Rails example:</p>

<p>``` ruby
class Notifier &lt; ActionMailer::Base
  include SendGrid
  default :from => Rails.configuration.sendgrid.reply_to
  sendgrid_enable :opentrack, :clicktrack, :ganalytics
  sendgrid_category :testing</p>

<p>  def user_updated(user)</p>

<pre><code>@user = user
mail( :to =&gt; @user.email, 
      :subject =&gt; "Your information has been updated.") do |format|
  format.text { "#{user.first_name},\n\nThis is an auto-response to inform you that your information has changed." }
  format.html { render :layout =&gt; 'autoresponse' }
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Super “thanks” go out to the <a href="http://sendgrid.com/" title="SendGrid">SendGrid</a> crew for their constantly superior customer service skills and for helping me out on my way to becoming an email marketing specialist.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my search for finding a simple solution to any problem, I usually cross many and many blogs and articles, discussing whatever topic. But with so much detail that the solution becomes a problem in itself. So I often times end up resolved to research on my own. In this case, I share the simplest programming method for displaying a <a href="http://flickr.com" title="Flickr">Flickr</a> gallery, with PHP.</p>

<h2>Assembling Your Variables</h2>

<p>``` perl
$api_key  = 'cr79h3t7g387ghc3fh7338ch87c3ch734';
$user_id  = '33822702%40N08';
$per_page = 10;</p>

<p>$xml      = 'http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?method=flickr.people.getPublicPhotos&amp;api_key='.$api_key.'&amp;user_id='.$user_id.'&amp;per_page='.$per_page;</p>

<p>$flickr   = simplexml_load_file($xml);
foreach($flickr->photos->photo as $p) {</p>

<pre><code>echo '&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/'.$p['owner'].'/'.$p['id'].'"&gt;';
echo '&lt;img src="http://farm'.$p['farm'].'.static.flickr.com/'.$p['server'].'/'.$p['id'].'_'.$p['secret'].'_s.jpg"&gt;';
echo '&lt;/a&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p><strong>$api_key</strong> is part of an authentication device that allows your server and Flickr to “shake hands” sort of speak. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/" title="Flickr API Key">You can get your Flickr API key here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>$user_id</strong> is how Flickr identifies you. This value can be found in the URL of your Flickr “photostream”. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33822702@N08/" title="Michael Minter's Flickr">Here's mine for reference</a>.</p>

<p><strong>$per_page</strong> refers to how many photos will be retrieved from your photostream. Though this limiter is optional, the default count is, “all”. Which means if you have 1,000 plus photos, it could be a very bad thing, for your viewer’s browser load time.</p>

<p><strong>$xml</strong> is a link to the webfile that renders a list of your available photos based on previously noted variables. This line can be modified later to include even more search parameters. (see: below)</p>

<p><strong>$flickr</strong> uses a PHP function called, <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.simplexml-load-file.php" title="simplexml_load_file function">simplexml_load_file()</a>, which parses an XML file into an object.</p>

<p>In today's lesson, <strong>$flickr</strong> becomes an array and we use <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php" title="foreach function">foreach()</a> to extract the values we need, to display the gallery.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This method is just what I needed. Something small, easily accessible, and scalable. As you experiment with this script, you’ll be afforded the opportunity to use many different features of the API, which Flickr offers. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/" title="Flickr API Index">Click here to view a full list.</a></p>
