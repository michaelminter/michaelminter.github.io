Recently been working with AutoCAD files for [my company](http://sitefm.com). Because CAD files, or DWF/DWG files are based on a proprietory software package, there's not a lot of documentation on working with them, and even less if you want to render them in your own product.

I was fortunate enough to come across [CADViewer](http://cadviewer.com). They're support is awesome and their product's API is superior to others available. The only catch is that they're a bit pricey. But eh.

When you need to debug a Java applet running on your website, there's only one way, and that's with Mac's built-in Java console.

    Applications > Utilities > Java Console

... and select 'Show console' with any other options you'd like to show up.
