When you need to debug a Java applet running on your website, there's only one way, and that's with Mac's built-in Java console.

Because Adobe DWF files are based on proprietory software, there's not a lot of documentation on working with them, and even less if you want to render them in your own product.

I was fortunate enough to come across a Java Applet by <a href="http://cadviewer.com" target="_blank">CADViewer</a>. They're support is awesome and their product's API is superior to any others I've seen available. They'll even work with you on a price to fit your circumstance.

But to debug any Java Applet in your Mac OS, do this:

    Applications > Utilities > Java Console

Click the `Show console` radio button and select any other options you'd like to show up while the Java console is running.
