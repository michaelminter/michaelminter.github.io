## Data
Objects should be indexed by id. Example:

``` javascript

### Ruby Tip

You can index by a hash by each record's unique ID using the Rails Enumerable method: <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/Enumerable/index_by" target="_blank">index_by</a>.

> Convert an enumerable to a hash. 

### Example

``` javascript
Workorder.all.index_by(&:id)
```

## Constructor

Initialize a new model class. If no localStorage table (key) is available one is created when the below code is parsed:

``` javascript
var Workorder = new Model('workorders');
```

## Find

The following will return the referenced object that belongs to its associated ID:

``` javascript
Workorder.find(101);
```

## Where

The following will return all workorders _where_ the created_at date is less than the decalred _date_ variable.

``` javascript
var date = new Date();
Workorder.where({name:"MichaelMinter",age:28,created_at:date,admin:true},{created_at:'<'})
```

### Variable Types

* __String__ utilizes Regex. Because the lookups are an object you _cannot_ use something like: `{description:"a",description:"b"}` but you _can_ do `{description:"[a-b]"}`
* __Numbers__ will only search literal integeral values. A variable string type, "1" is not the same as the variable number type, 1.
* __Object__ is exclusive to dates and an option object `{due_date:">"}` is required to evaluaute references.
* __Boolean__ will only search literal boolean values. So `{notifications:true}` is _not_ the same as `{notifications:"true"}`.
* __Null__ will return any empty, or _null_, values. `null` is not the same as `""`.

## More

Extends __Storage__

``` javascript
if (window.Storage){
  Storage.prototype.setObject = function(key, value) {
    "use strict";
    this.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  };
      
  Storage.prototype.getObject = function(key) {
    "use strict";
    var value = this.getItem(key);
    return value && JSON.parse(value);
  };
} else {
  alert('localStorage is not supported on this browser')
}
```
